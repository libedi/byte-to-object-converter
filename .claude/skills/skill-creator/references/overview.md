# Agent Skills Overview

> A standardized way to give AI agents new capabilities and expertise.

## What are Agent Skills?

Agent Skills are a lightweight, open format for extending AI agent capabilities with specialized knowledge and workflows.

At its core, a skill is a folder containing a `SKILL.md` file. This file includes metadata (`name` and `description`, at minimum) and instructions that tell an agent how to perform a specific task. Skills can also bundle scripts, reference materials, templates, and other resources.

```
my-skill/
├── SKILL.md          # Required: metadata + instructions
├── scripts/          # Optional: executable code
├── references/       # Optional: documentation
├── assets/           # Optional: templates, resources
└── ...               # Any additional files or directories
```

## Why Agent Skills?

Agents are increasingly capable, but often don't have the context they need to do real work reliably. Skills solve this by packaging procedural knowledge and company-, team-, and user-specific context into portable, version-controlled folders that agents load on demand. This gives agents:

* **Domain expertise**: Capture specialized knowledge — from legal review processes to data analysis pipelines to presentation formatting — as reusable instructions and resources.
* **Repeatable workflows**: Turn multi-step tasks into consistent, auditable procedures.
* **Cross-product reuse**: Build a skill once and use it across any skills-compatible agent.

## How do Agent Skills work?

Agents load skills through **progressive disclosure**, in three stages:

1. **Discovery**: At startup, agents load only the name and description of each available skill, just enough to know when it might be relevant.

2. **Activation**: When a task matches a skill's description, the agent reads the full `SKILL.md` instructions into context.

3. **Execution**: The agent follows the instructions, optionally executing bundled code or loading referenced files as needed.

Full instructions load only when a task calls for them, so agents can keep many skills on hand with only a small context footprint.
